	<h1>Our Mission</h1>
	<p> 
		Ever feel like you wasted an afternoon or weekend? Your time is a precious and limited resource. Our goal is to help you spend it in enriching yourself and your community. 
	</p><br>
	<p> 
		We bring you events that are hosted by organizations dedicated to making the world a better place. Participate in diverse activities, meet new people, and live the stories you will remember for the rest of your life. What are you waiting for?

	<p>
		Our events are only a few hours and are designed for you to get your feet wet. If you are interested in volunteering, please visit the organization's home page for more details.
